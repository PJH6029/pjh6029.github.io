## Long Term Goal

Recursively self-improving agents equipped with personalized memory.

---

## Objective

Push the capabilities of large language models across pre-training, post-training, multimodal extensions, and interpretability, ultimately enabling self-improving and reliable agentic systems.

## Experience

### Research Intern · Human-Centered Computer System Lab, SNU (Apr 2025 – Dec 2025)
- Advancing the Lumo project by developing natural-language agents that rely on robust API-based tool-calling.
- Exploring limitations of existing agent patterns (e.g., ReAct) and proposing/new prototyping architectures for higher accuracy.
- Shifted focus from prompt tweaks to system-level agent-pattern research for harder, multi-step tasks.

### Software Engineering Intern · FADU (Jul 2024 – Aug 2024)
- Built an internal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for navigating technical specifications.
- Designed a scalable pipeline that integrates multiple LLM providers and vector databases for reliable document access.

### Teaching Assistant · Seoul National University (Sep 2022 – Present)
- Supported **Computer Programming (2022 Fall, Prof. Lee)**, **Logic Design (2024 Spring, Prof. Lee)**, **Programming Practice (2024 Fall, Prof. Jeon)**, and **Basic Computing (2024 Fall, Prof. Kim; 2025 Spring, Prof. Yamada)**.

## Projects

### ARC-AGI Task Solver using LoRA Fine-Tuning (2025 Spring)
- Fine-tuned Qwen3-4B on ARC-AGI tasks using LoRA adapters and heavy data augmentation.
- Built an inference stack combining few-shot prompting, test-time training, and majority voting for stable outputs.
- Crafted a fine-grained loss to extract informative gradients from few-shot examples, accelerating convergence.

### Minimal Deep Learning Framework (2024 Winter)
- Implemented a PyTorch-like framework with define-by-run backprop and GPU acceleration via CuPy.
- Built a dynamic computation graph and autograd engine from scratch for educational clarity.
